	<h1>Regal Nails Salon and Spa FAQ</h1>
	
	<p>
		At Regal Nails Salon and Spa we respect our customers and their privacy. We try to keep their experice as joyful and convenient as possible. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Some question customers might ask are:
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Are your tools sterile and clean?</li>
			<p>Yes. According to California's State Board, tools need to at least be disinfected by a hospital-grade sanitizer, such as Barbicide. We choose to sterilize our tools with an autoclave, which is a step above sanitization.</p>
			<li>What is the difference between a typical sterilizer and an autoclave.</li>
			<p>UV light sterilizers are typically what are seen in most nail salons, but they don’t really do anything. It’s as if you left your tools out in the sun. An autoclave or dry heat sterilizer is a medical-grade device used in medical offices that is able to reach the ideal temperature for killing all bacteria. This is considered the highest level of sterilization. </p>
			<li>What tools are single use items</li>
			<p>Single-use items would be anything that cannot be sanitized. Such as nail files, buffers and pumice bars. We too often see these items being reused in salons all around the world.</p>
		</ul>
